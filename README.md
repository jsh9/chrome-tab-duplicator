# chrome-tab-duplicator

This is a Chrome and Edge extension to duplicate the current tab with a mouse click or a keyboard shortcut.

There is no built-in keyboard shortcut to duplicate tabs in Chrome or Edge, which is why I wrote this extension to improve productivity.


## 1. Installation

Please go the Chrome Web Store to install it: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-duplicator/lfmcdmbfaplkbjkefabcfbkfelmhhboa


## 2. How to use

With your mouse or trackpad, simply click on this extension's icon.

Alternatively, use the following keyboard shortcut:
- Windows and Linux: `Alt + Shift + 2`
- macOS: `Option + Shift + 2`
