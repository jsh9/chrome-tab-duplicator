# chrome-tab-duplicator

This is a Chrome and Edge extension to duplicate the current tab with a mouse click or a keyboard shortcut.

There is no built-in keyboard shortcut to duplicate tabs in Chrome or Edge, which is why I wrote this extension to improve productivity.


## 1. Installation

This extension is not on the Chrome Web Store yet. To install it manually into your Chrome or Edge browser, following the steps below:

1. Download this extension. You can choose either options:

2. Manually load the downloaded/cloned files into the browser:
